This repository will store my first graphical python game played through pygame. I developed it over a very long time starting with knowing next to no python to now working in a job that leverages python all day long. I often come back to look at the organization of the code in this game with horror but also admiration with how far I have come. From now on I only add features as requested 

Feel free to browse the contents, clone, fork, change, etc...

No guarantee it will work for you. I run python 3.7.7 on MacOS.

# Using this repo

Install the Python3 dependencies from `requirements.txt` then simply run `./main.py` and it should start right up!

## Customizing
If you want to add custom skins, then add images (preferably actual PNG images) with the following names:
- `background.png`
- `enemy.png`
- `fist.png`
- `player.png`
into a folder of your own creation. The name of the folder will correspond to the name of the skin in the game. The file named `background.png` (as you may have guessed) will become the background image of your skin for the game. You must name the images exactly as described above and must include them in the `/images/` folder inside of one and only one other folder.
